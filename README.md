# Project Details
I created a calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:

   - p, principal amount
   - t, time period in years
   - r, annual rate of interest
   
Output

   - simple interest = p*t*r
   
The above has been implemented in a .sh shell file. Do check it out!
